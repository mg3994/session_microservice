Generate Steering Rules

Kiro
Kiro uses generative AI. You may need to verify responses, code, and artifacts Kiro generates. See our Responsible AI Policy. Kiro processes data across all US Regions. Kiro may retain chats to provide and maintain the service.

Kiro may collect client-side telemetry and process content that may be used for service improvement. You can change this in Settings.

I'll analyze the repository structure and create the steering rules. Let me first examine the key files to understand the project better.

Including Steering Documents

structure.md
Perfect! I've successfully created the three basic steering documents for your microservices repository:

Created Files:
.kiro/steering/product.md - Overview of the dairy/vegetable delivery platform with its core services and business features
.kiro/steering/tech.md - PHP 8.1+ tech stack, Wasmer deployment, environment variables, and common commands
.kiro/steering/structure.md - Monorepo organization with standardized microservice structure patterns
These steering rules will now guide AI assistants working in this codebase to understand:

The business context (fresh produce delivery platform)
Technical constraints (PHP, MySQL, Wasmer deployment)
Project conventions (PSR-4 autoloading, standardized directory structure)
Development workflows (composer, parallel deployment via GitHub Actions)
The documents are concise but capture the essential information needed for effective code assistance in this microservices environment.

We have Github workflow to deploy the Microservices

we have different microservices like auth, pay, social (for social media kind chat and video call), delivery and multivendor 

for MySQL we have some fixed ## Environment Variables

Services use environment-based configuration for:

- `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`: Database connection

- `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`: Database credentials 

Also you can add more Variables but you have no guide me what variable you have used and for what microservice , also do update Readme file for that to show variables in Use

‚úÖ Core Responsibilities of multivendor service:

Responsibility ¬†Description

Vendor Onboarding ¬† Registration, KYC, location, business type (dairy, veggies, etc.)

Vendor Product Management ¬† Vendors can add/edit/delete items they supply

Pricing & Availability ¬†Vendors manage price per unit, stock level, batch

Vendor Subscription Setup ¬† Vendors can enable recurring orders for their products

Vendor Dashboard APIs ¬† Orders, sales reports, delivery status, feedback

Vendor Role Management ¬†Multiple logins (owner, manager, delivery staff)

Vendor Notification Hooks ¬† Low stock alerts, delivery failures, etc.

Payout Management Hooks Integrate with payment service to trigger vendor settlements

Vendor-specific Promotions ¬†Vendors run own coupons/discounts

# we Do also run Dairy Products and vegitables delivery at doorstep with or without subscription based models for these we can have

¬†Expiry

Origin/farm

Organic tag

Packaging type (loose, bottle, sealed)(for dairy milk)

for these i need 

Smart Features:

Auto-remove expired items from cart/search

Predictive stock alerts for daily needs

Warehouse ‚Üî Local delivery sync

For daily/weekly recurring orders.

Key Features:

Customer preferences: quantity, time, delivery days

Pause/resume logic

Vendor delivery capacity checks

Auto-order generation nightly (e.g., 2AM)

This service merges:

Subscription Orders

On-demand Orders

By:

Location

Vendor

Delivery slot

Specific to perishables:

Vendors define cold-chain capable or not

Delivery slots have freshness windows (e.g., before 8AM for milk)

If missed, item flagged as "return to vendor" with refund

For milk/veggies:

Store FSSAI license, farm/produce origin

Batch ‚Üí Vendor ‚Üí Location ‚Üí Order mapping

Use case:

Trace food safety incidents

Prove freshness & source compliance

and here for notification-service we use firebase notification (single firebase project for all our microservices) and SMS as well as Email

# Pay 

payments, refunds, payouts and more

Kiro
I can see you've provided a comprehensive overview of your microservices platform. Based on this information, it looks like you want to create a spec for implementing the multivendor service with all its complex features around dairy and vegetable delivery.

Let me create a spec for the multivendor service since it appears to be the most complex and central service with many interconnected features.

Created

requirements.md


Do the requirements look good? If so, we can move on to the design.

Great! Now I'll create the design document based on the approved requirements.

Created

design.md


Does the design look good? If so, we can move on to the implementation plan.

Perfect! Now I'll create the implementation plan with actionable coding tasks.

Created

tasks.md


Do the tasks look good?

Perfect! I've successfully created a comprehensive spec for the multivendor service with:

‚úÖ Completed Spec Documents:
Requirements - 8 major requirements covering vendor onboarding, product management, subscriptions, delivery coordination, analytics, payments, notifications, and compliance
Design - Detailed architecture with 7 core modules, database schema, error handling, and testing strategy
Tasks - 14 main implementation phases with 28 sub-tasks, all focused on actionable coding work
üöÄ Ready for Implementation
The spec is now complete and ready for execution. You can begin implementing by:

Opening the tasks file: Navigate to .kiro/specs/multivendor-service/tasks.md
Starting with Task 1: Click "Start task" next to "Set up project structure and core interfaces"
Working incrementally: Complete each task before moving to the next
The implementation plan follows a logical progression from basic setup through core functionality to advanced features, ensuring each step builds on the previous work. The tasks are designed to be executed by a coding agent with clear, actionable objectives and specific requirement references.

This spec captures the complexity of your dairy and vegetable delivery platform while breaking it down into manageable, testable components that can be implemented systematically.

make sure you do make one more thing , like for running migration for all microservices automatically from our admin panel  where we will get our admin username and admin pasword from Envirenment variable if not available use username as admin and password be admin to install those migrationas and initial steps

Booking system - Slot reservation and release functionality
6.2 Order Consolidation Logic ‚úÖ
OrderConsolidator - Smart grouping by location, vendor, and delivery slot
Location clustering - GPS coordinate-based grouping (100m radius)
Multi-order optimization - Subscription + on-demand order merging
Efficiency scoring - Optimization metrics for delivery routes
Product aggregation - Combined product quantities per delivery
Customer consolidation - Multiple customers per delivery route
Cold-chain awareness - Temperature requirement consolidation
6.3 Delivery Failure Handling ‚úÖ
DeliveryFailureHandler - Intelligent failure processing with refund automation
Freshness-aware decisions - Return vs dispose based on product shelf life
Multiple strategies - Reschedule, contact customer, return/refund, dispose/refund
