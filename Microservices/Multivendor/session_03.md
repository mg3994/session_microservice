Understood. I have the context from our previous conversation and am ready to continue helping you.

let's continue

I can see you have an existing multivendor-service spec that we've been working on. Looking at the tasks file, I can see we have a comprehensive implementation plan with many tasks already completed.

Let me check the current status of the tasks to see where we left off:

Read file(s)

tasks.md
I can see we're currently working on task 8 (notification system) and it's marked as in progress. Looking at the subtasks, we need to continue with:

8.1 Create notification dispatcher (currently incomplete)
8.2 Build stock alert system
8.3 Implement delivery notifications
Let me continue with task 8.1 - creating the notification dispatcher. I'll update the task status and implement the remaining notification components.

Task: 8.1 Create notification dispatcher from 
tasks.md
Status: In Progress
Now let me complete the NotificationTemplateManager that was partially created and then build the NotificationDispatcher:
